Game Thoughts
this game can be a NeuralBased HardCore game basic focus on the magic Attack and Defense.
i think the name can be "Neural&Attack&Defense"

it basicly have two main class magic Attack and Defense magic
it can be other version, like the Electromagnetism Attack and Defense
and i want a Electromaganetism simulation engine and base on this engine to construct the Nerual gameplay that is to use Nerual to manipulate the input output to shot out Attack and Defense.
